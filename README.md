# **Classification of Garment Workers' Productivity Status: Identifying Factors Affecting Target Achievement**

## **Project Description**

This project aims to classify the productivity status of garment workers using machine learning models. It analyzes various factors that influence the achievement of productivity targets. By utilizing a dataset containing worker information, the project builds a model to understand and predict productivity status effectively.

## **Dataset**

The dataset used: /notebook/garments_worker_productivity.csv

This dataset includes information such as:
- Working hours
- Product categories
- Daily efficiency
- Overtime, and more.

The dataset serves as the foundation for building a predictive model to classify productivity status.

## **Machine Learning Models**  
This project employs machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest and Logistic Regression to classify productivity status. The models are evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall to ensure optimal performance.
